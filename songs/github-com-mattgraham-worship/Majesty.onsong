[G]Majesty, worship His [C]majesty
Unto [G]Jesus be all glory, honor and [D]praise,
[G]Majesty, kingdom [C]authority
Flows from His [G]throne, unto His [D]own
His Anthem [G]raise.

So [D]exalt, lift up on high, the name of [G]Jesus
Magni[D]fy, come glorify Christ Jesus the [B]King [D7]

[G]Majesty, worship His [C]majesty
Jesus who [G]died, now glori[D]fied
King of all [G]kings.
