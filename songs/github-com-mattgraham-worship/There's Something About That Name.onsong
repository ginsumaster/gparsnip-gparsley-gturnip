Title: There's Something About That Name
Artist: William Gaither
Key: [D]
Original Key: D

[D]Jesus, [D7]Jesus, [D7]Jesus
There's just [G]something a[C9]bout that [D7]name  [G/A]
[D]Master, [D7]Saviour, [D9]Jesus
Like the [E9]fragrance after the [Em7]rain [A]
[D]Jesus, [D7]Jesus, [D7]Jesus
Let all [G]Heaven and Earth [F#]proclaim
[B]Kings and [B7]kingdoms
Will [E9]all pass away
But there's [Em7]something [A]about that [D]Name.
