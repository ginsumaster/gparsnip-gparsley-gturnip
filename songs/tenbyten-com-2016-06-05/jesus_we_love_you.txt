Old things have [E]passed away
Your love has [B2]stayed the same
Your constant [E]grace remains the cornerst[B2]one
Things that we thought were dead
Are breathing in life again
You cause Your Son to shine on darkest nights

For [F#]all that You’ve done
We will [G#m]pour out our love
This will [E]be our anthem s[F#]ong

The hopeless have found their hope
The orphans now have a home
All that was lost has found its place in you
You lift our weary head
You make us strong instead
You took these rags and made us beautiful

For [F#]all that You’ve done
We will [G#m]pour out our love
This will [E]be our anthem s[F#]ong
