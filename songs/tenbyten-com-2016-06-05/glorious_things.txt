[Ab]God, I’ll tell my daughters and sons
To the ones who’ve yet to come the glory
That crowns You
God, I’ll sing while I am young, sing till this
Breath of mine is done
The beauty surrounds You

[Db]Glorious things are spoken o[Ab]f You
[Db]Glorious things too great to [Ab]tell
[Db]Glorious things are spoken o[Ab]f You
You make [Bbm]everything
[Db]Beautiful and glorious

[Ab]God, I will tell of Your kindness and strength
The way You lifted and carried me, Your mercy amazing
God, You're not like man, You do not leave
I will hold fast; I will believe
You're never changing

I will [Db]say it is true; Your love is not removed
And I will [Ab]say it is true; Your love is not removed
And I will [Db]say it is true; Your love endures all my[Ab] days
