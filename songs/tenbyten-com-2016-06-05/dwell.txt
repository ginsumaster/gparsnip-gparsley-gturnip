[G]Dwell in the midst [Dm7] of us [Cno3rd]
Come and dwell in this place
Dwell in the midst of us
Come and have Your way

Dwell in the midst of us
Wipe all the tears from our faces
Dwell in the midst of us
You can have Your way

{soc}
Not our will but Yours be done, come and change us
Not our will but Yours be done, come sustain us
