[E]How deep the Father's [F#m7]love [E/G#A2]for us
How [E/G#]vast beyond all [C#m7B7sus]measure
[E]That He should give His [F#m7E/G#A2]only son
To [E/B]make a wretch His [B7]trea[E]sure
How [E/G#]great the pain of [A/C#E/B]searing [A2]loss
The [E/G#]Father turns his [C#m7]face a[B7sus]way
[E]As wounds which mar the [F#m7E/G#A2]Chosen One
Bring [E/B]many sons to [B7]glo[E]ry

[E][F#m7][E/G#][A2][E/B][B7][E]
Behold the man upon the cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection
Why should I gain from His reward? 
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom
