Let the [Bb]King of my heart 
be the [Eb]mountain when I [Bb]run
The [Gm]fountain I drink [Fsus4]from; 
oh He [Eb]is my [Bb]song

Let the King of my heart 
be the shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life; 
oh He is my song

You are [Gm]good, [Fsus4]good, [Eb]Oh [Bb][(F/A)]
You are [Gm]good, [Fsus4]good, [Eb]Oh [Bb]

Let the King of my heart 
be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves; 
oh He is my song

Let the King of my heart 
be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days; 
oh He is my song

{start_of_chorus}
You are good, good, Oh — You are good, good, Oh

never gonna let me down
[Gm]You're never gonna let, 
never gonna let me down

When the [Gm]night is [F]holding [Ebmaj7]on to m[Bb]e
[Cm]God is [Bb]holding [Eb]on
