I c[Gm7]annot believe I'm this d[F]irty
I'm ash[Gm7]amed to even ask t[F/A]o be c[Bb]lean
I c[Gm7]an't think of anyone less wor[F]thy
I have n[Gm7]othing to offer or [F/A]to b[Bb]ring
So I t[C]hrow m[Dm]yself on Your m[Bb]ercy
I th[C]row m[Dm]yself at Your [Bb]feet
I t[C]hrow my f[Dm]ilth on the [Bb]grace of One whose b[F/A]eauty is b[Gm7]eyond me
And I wa[C]it[Dm][C][Bb]
And I wa[C]it[Dm][C][Bb]

I [Gm7]don't even know how I g[F]ot here
W[Gm7]andered to this darkness from [F/A]Your l[Bb]ight
I s[Gm7]till remember walking in the ga[F]rden with You
[Gm7]Now I'm just stumbling through t[F/A]his n[Bb]ight
So I t[C]hrow m[Dm]yself on Your m[Bb]ercy
I th[C]row mys[Dm]elf at Your f[Bb]eet
I t[C]hrow my f[Dm]ilth on the g[Bb]race of One whose [F/A]beauty is b[Gm7]eyond me
And I wa[C]it[Dm][C][Bb]
And I wa[C]it[Dm][C][Bb]

I wa[F]it for Your ra[C]in to [Gm7]fall
The wa[F]ves of Your gr[C]ace to wash o[Bb]ver me
I w[F]ait for Your ra[C]in to [Gm7]fall
St[F]range how for[C]giveness comes so ea[Dm]sily when [C]I call Your n[Bb]ame
[Gm7]And wait for Your rain

[F][C][Gm7][F][C][Bb]
{gc:(2x)}

L[Eb]ord, this desert is k[Bb]illing me
My t[F]hroat's dry from screaming Your n[C]ame
I w[Eb]ant to come home but the sa[Bb]nds of time surround me
The di[F]rt's finally covered my [Bb]shame

So I th[C]row m[Dm]yself on Your m[Bb]ercy
I th[C]row my[Dm]self at Your f[Bb]eet
I t[C]hrow my f[Dm]ilth on the g[Bb]race of One whose b[F/A]eauty is [Gm7]beyond me
And I wa[C]it[Dm][C][Bb]

I wa[F]it for Your ra[C]in to [Gm7]fall
The wa[F]ves of Your gr[C]ace to wash o[Bb]ver me
I w[F]ait for Your ra[C]in to [Gm7]fall
St[F]range how for[C]giveness comes so ea[Bb]sily
I wa[F]it for Your ra[C]in to [Gm7]fall
The wa[F]ves of Your gr[C]ace to wash o[Bb]ver me
I w[F]ait for Your ra[C]in to [Gm7]fall
St[F]range how for[C]giveness comes so ea[Dm]sily when [C]I call Your n[Bb]ame
[Gm7]And wait for Your ra[C]in[Dm][C][Bb]
