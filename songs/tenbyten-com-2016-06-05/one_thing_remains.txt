[Cmaj9]Higher than the mo[G]untains that I [Dsus]face
[Cmaj9]Stronger than the [G]power of the[Dsus] grave
[Cmaj9]Constant in the tri[G]al and the chan[Dsus]ge
One [C]thing[G] re[Dsus]mains
One [C]thing[G] re[Dsus]mains

Your love[Em7] never fails, [Cadd9]never gives up
N[G]ever runs out on [Dsus]me (3x)

[Cmaj9]On and on and [G]on and on it go[Dsus]es
[Cmaj9]It overwhelms and [G]satisfies my [Dsus]soul
And I [Cmaj9]never, ever, [G]have to be a[Dsus]fraid
One [Cmaj9]thing [G]rem[Dsus]ains

In d[Cmaj9]eath, In [G]life, I’m [D]confident and
[Am7]covered by the p[Cmaj9]ower of [G]Your great [D]love
My[Cmaj9] debt is [G]paid, th[D]ere’s nothing that can
[Am7]separate my h[Cmaj9]eart from Y[G/B]our [G]great l[D]ove
