[D]Though the Earth cried [A]out for blood
[Bm]Satisfied her hunger [G]was
Her [D]billows calmed on [A]raging seas for the [Bm]souls of men she [G]craved

[D]Sun and moon from [A]balcony
[Bm]Turned their head in [G]disbelief
Their [D]precious Love would taste the [A]sting, dis[Bm]figured and [G]disdained

{soc}
On [D]Friday a [A]thief
On [G]Sunday a [D]King
[D]Laid down in [A]grief
But [G]awoke with [D]keys
To [Bm]Hell on that [A]day
The first [G]born of the [D]slain
The [Bm]man Jesus [A]Christ
Laid [G]death in his [D]grave
{eoc}

[D]So three days in darkness [A]slept
The [Bm]Morning Sun of [G]Righteousness
But [D]rose to shame the [A]throes of death and [Bm]overturn his [G]rule

Now [D]daughters and the [A]sons of men
Would [Bm]pay not their [G]dues again
The [D]debt of blood they [A]owed was rent, when the [Bm]day rolled a[G]new

{soc}
On Friday a thief
On Sunday a King
Laid down in grief
But awoke with keys
To Hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The man Jesus Christ
Laid death in his grave
Death in his grave
Death in his grave
Death in his grave
{eoc}

[G]He has cheated
[Bm]Hell and seated
[A]Us above the [G]fall
In [G]desperate places
He [Bm]paid our wages
[A]One time once and for [G]all
