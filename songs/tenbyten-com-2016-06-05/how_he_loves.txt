{title:How He Loves}
{key: C}
[C]He is jealous for me
[Am]Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
[G]Bending beneath the weight of his wind and [Fmaj7]mercy
[C]When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these [Am]afflictions eclipsed by glory
And I [G]realize just how beautiful You are
And how [Fmaj7]great Your affections are for me

{gc:Pre-Chorus:}
And [C]oh, how He loves us [Am]oh
Oh how He [G]loves us,
How He loves us [Fmaj7]all
[C][Am7][G][Fmaj7]

{gc:Repeat Verse 1 & Pre-Chorus}

{soc}
[C]He loves us, oh how He [Am]loves us,
Oh how He [G]loves us, oh how He [Fmaj7]loves.
{eoc}

We are His portion and He is our prize,
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
If grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking
So Heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss,
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
I don’t have time to maintain these regrets,
When I think about, the way…

{soc}
He loves us, woah how He loves us,
Woah how He loves us, woah how He loves.
{eoc}

I thought about You
The day Stephen died
And You met me between my breaking
I know that I still love You God
Despite the agony
See people they want to tell me You’re cruel
But if Stephen could sing
He’d say it’s not true
Cause You’re good﻿

{soc}
‘Cause You love us, oh how You love us,
Oh how You love us, oh how You love.
{eoc}
