[Am7][Em7][D]
In [G]Christ a[D]lone my [G]hope is [A]found,
[D/F#]He is my [G]light, [D/F#]my   [Em7]strength,[G/A] my s[D]ong;
This [G]Corner[D]stone, this [G]solid [A]ground,
[D/F#]Firm through the [G]fierc[D/F#]est  [Em7]drou[G/A]ght and [D]storm.
What [D/F#]heights of [G]love, what [D/F#]depths of [Asus]peace,[A]
When [D/F#]fears are [G]stilled, when [Bm7]strivings [Asus]cease![A]
My [G]Comfort[D]er, my [G]All in [A]All,
[D/F#]Here in the [G]love [D/F#]of   [Em7]Christ [G/A]I   [D]stand.

In Christ alone! — who took on flesh,
Fulness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save: 
Till on the cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied — 
For every sin on Him was laid; 
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain: 
Then bursting forth in glorious Day 
Up from the grave He rose again! 
And as He stands in victory
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine —
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death, 
This is the power of Christ in me; 
From life’s first cry to final breath, 
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man, 
Can ever pluck me from His hand; 
Till He returns of calls me home, 
Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand!
