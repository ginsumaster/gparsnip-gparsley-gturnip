[G] As children we[D/F#] come with arms open w[Asus]ide[A]
[G] So desperate for [D/F#]You, so in need of Your li[Asus]fe[A]
[G] May our praise fill Your [D/F#]ears, may our cries touch Your h[Asus]eart[A]
[G] (‘Cause) We need Your [D/F#]presence to change who we a[Asus]re, so [G2]we ask...

{start_of_chorus}
[D]Come, Holy Spirit, [Bm]come in Your power
Come in[Asus]habit our praise
Come now and re[G]ign in our lives
[D]Come, Holy Spirit, [Bm]come like the wind
Come be [Asus]Lord of our hearts
Come fill Your ch[G]urch once again[G][D/F#][A]
{end_of_chorus}

[A]You said if w[Bm]e asked for bre[G]ad
[A]That You’d gi[Bm]ve us no s[G]tone
[A] So [Bm]in all of o[G]ur hearts
[A] God, we k[Bm]neel and we gr[G]oan…[A] we ask
