[A]You stood before creation
[D]eternity in Your hand
[A/C#]You spoke the earth into [F#m]motion
My soul now [D]to stand

[A]You stood before my failure
And [D]carried the cross for my shame
My [A/C#]sin weighed upon Your shou[F#m]lders
My soul now [D]to stand

So what can I say[D]
[Bm]And what could I do[F#m]
But offer this heart[D] O God[E]
Complete[F#m]ly to You[A][E][F#m][D][A][E][F#m]

So [A]I'll walk upon salvation
Your [D]Spirit alive in me
This [A/C#]life to declare Your p[F#m]romise
My soul now [D]to stand

So what can I say[D]
[Bm]And what could I do[F#m]
But offer this heart[D] O God[E]
Complete[F#m]ly to You[A][E][F#m][D][A][E][F#m]

{start_of_chorus}
[D]So I'll st[A]and
With [E]arms high and [F#m]heart abandoned[D]
In [A]awe of the [E]One who [F#m]gave it all[D]
I'll st[A]and
My s[E]oul Lord to [F#m]You surrendered
[D]All I am[A] is Yours[E][F#m]
{end_of_chorus}

So what can I say[D]
[Bm]And what could I do[F#m]
[A]But offer this hear[Bm7]t O God[E]
Complete[F#m]ly to You
