{key: A}
Like [A]deer to the pool 
I’m [E]coming after you
Like a [D/F#]thirsty animal
My [A/E]heart is for your [E]love

Like [A]Jonah from the deep
I’m [E]coming out of my sleep
To find the [D/F#]secrets that you keep
Is the [A/E]only thing worth rising [E]for

[D]From the dirt you’ve drawn me [A]out
And you draw me [Esus]out ag[E]ain
[D]I’m coming back from the [A]dead
I’m coming out of my [Esus]skin

{soc}
[A]You are everything my [A/E]heart wants
Everything my [D/F#]heart wants
My heart runs
[A/E]My heart runs after [E]You
{eoc}

Like breakers on the shore
You’re knocking on my door
Like the deepest places in you
Are calling to the fountains of my soul

From the dirt you’ve drawn me out
And you draw me out again
I’m coming back from the dead
I’m coming out of my skin

{soc}
You are everything my heart wants
Everything my heart wants
My heart runs
My heart runs after You
{eoc}

[A]So my heart runs
[A/E]So my heart runs
[D/F#]So my heart runs
[A/E]My heart runs [E]after You
