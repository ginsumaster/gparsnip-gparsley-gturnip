Bless the [C]Lord, O my [G]soul
[D/F#]O my [Em]soul
[C]Worship His ho[G]ly nam[Dsus4]e [D]
Sing like [C]never be[Em]fore
[C]O [D]my [Em]soul
I'll [C]worship Your ho[D]ly nam[C/G]e[G]

The [C]sun comes [G]up, it's a [D]new day [Em]dawning
[C]It's time to [G]sing Your so[D]ng again[Em]
What[C]ever may [G]pass, and what[D]ever lies be[Em]fore me
[C]Let me be [G]singing when the [Dsus4]eve[D]ning [G]comes [Gsus4] [G]

{c:Chorus}

You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger
Your name is great, and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

{c:Chorus}

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

{c:Chorus}
