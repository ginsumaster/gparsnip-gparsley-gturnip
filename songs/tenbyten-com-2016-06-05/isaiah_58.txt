{t:Isaiah 58}
{key:Bb}
[Ab]Loose[Eb/G] the [Bb]chains
[Ab]Break[Eb/G] the [Bb]yoke
[Ab]Clothe[Eb/G] the [Bb]poor
[Ab]Share[Eb/G] your [Bb]food

[Bb]Then your [F/A]light will [Ab9]shine in the [Eb]dark[Bb/D]ness[Cm7]
And your [F]night will be[Gm]come like the [F/A]day
[Bb]Then your [F/A]righteous[Ab9]ness will go be[Eb]fore [Bb/D]you[Cm7]
And the [F]glory of the [Gm]Lord will be your [Ab]rearguard [Eb/G] 

And you will [Bb]call upon His name and He will [Ab]answer [Eb/G]
And [Bb]strengthen your frame
Like a [Ab]garden [Eb/G]
In a [Bb]sun-scorched land
You'll be a [Ab]well-spring  [Eb/G]
Whose [Bb]waters never fail and when you [Cm7]cry for help
The [Bb/D]Lord will say [Eb9]"Here I am"

[Cm7]We will re[Bb/D]build the ancient [Eb9]ruins
[Cm7]We will re[Bb/D]pair the broken [Eb9]walls
[Cm7]The King of [Bb/D]Glory will come [Eb9]in
[Eb]The Lord Al[F]mighty will come [Gm11]in

[Cm7]We will re[Bb/D]build the ancient [Eb9]ruins
	(Lift up your heads O ye gates)
[Cm7]We will re[Bb/D]pair the broken [Eb9]walls
	(Be lifted up you ancient doors)
[Cm7]The King of [Bb/D]Glory will come [Eb9]in
	(Who is this King?)
[Eb]The Lord Al[F]mighty will come [Gm11]in

And be your [Ab]rearguard [Eb/G]
And we will [Bb]call upon Your name and You will [Ab]answer [Eb/G]
And [Bb]strengthen our frame
Like a [Ab]garden [Eb/G]
In a [Bb]sun-scorched land we'll be a [Ab]well-spring  [Eb/G]
Whose [Bb]waters never fail and when we [Cm7]cry for help
[Bb/D]You will say [Eb9]"Here I am"

[Ab]Spend[Eb/G] your[B]self
Find your joy
Ride the heights
Feast on God
