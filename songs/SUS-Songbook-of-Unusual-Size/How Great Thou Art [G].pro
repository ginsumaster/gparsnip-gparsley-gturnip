{soh}Verse 1:{eoh}
O Lord my [G]God  when I in [C]awesome wonder
Consider [G]all the [D7]worlds Thy hands have [G]made
I see the [G]stars  I hear the [C]rolling thunder
Thy pow'r thru'[G]out  the [D7]universe dis[G]played

{soh}Chorus:{eoh}
{start_of_chorus}
[D] Then sings my [G]soul  my [C]Savior God to [G]Thee
[Em] How great Thou [Am]art  how [C/D]great Thou [GM7]art
[D] Then sings my [G]soul  my [C]Savior God to [G]Thee
[Em] How great Thou [Am]art [D7] how great Thou [G]art
{end_of_chorus}

{soh}Verse 2:{eoh}
When through the [G]woods  and forest [C]glades I wander
And hear the [G]birds  sing [D7]sweetly in the [G]trees
When I look [G]down  from lofty [C]mountain grandeur
And hear the [G]brook  and [D7]feel the gentle [G]breeze

{soh}Verse 3:{eoh}
And when I think  that God His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die  I scarce can take it in
That on the cross  my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died  to take away my sin

{soh}Verse 4:{eoh}
When Christ shall come  with shout of acclamation
And take me home  what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow  in humble adoration
And there proclaim  my God how great Thou art
